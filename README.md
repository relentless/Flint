My initial attempts at creating a Lisp interpreter in F#, based on [Phil Trelfords's blog/talk on a similar topic](http://trelford.com/blog/post/interpreter.aspx).

The Lisp is based on [John McCarthy's Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf).

I've never made an interpreter before, or used Lisp, so don't use this as any kind of example of how to do it!
